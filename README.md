## Description of the project
The purchase or sale of a house is one of the most important events in adult life. When choosing the right property, we consider not only its size but also its location, available transportation, finishing standard, and even the assessment of the neighborhood. The following work aims to examine the real estate market in Warsaw and its surrounding areas. A detailed assessment of factors influencing the prices of suburban houses will allow us to identify the most significant factors that buyers and sellers pay the most attention to when valuing properties.

The dataset was created based on information available on the morizon.pl website. Morizon.pl is one of the largest portals presenting current offers for the sale and rent of houses and apartments. The presented offers came from both property owners (direct listings) and intermediaries as well as developers. The offers covered the period of January-February 2021. Additionally, the database contained information about the district in which the property was located. Characteristics describing the level of education, air pollution, average income of the municipality or district were also included.

In the first step, the structure of the database itself was analyzed for missing elements and issues with the format of stored data. Then, unusual observations that significantly affected the analysis were identified. In further steps before starting the analysis, the correlation between available variables was tested to eliminate the bias of the results, and variable transformations were made to use them in the process of modeling the price per square meter.

The study of the impact of the most important factors was based on the analysis of Classical Linear Regression Model. Then, the use of the obtained results in the valuation process of a sample property was presented. Finally, a graphical analysis was conducted, and rankings were presented showing trends and characteristics of the analyzed market.
